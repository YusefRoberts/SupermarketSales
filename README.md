Supermarket Sales Analysis

Throughout this analysis, I used SQL techniques such as sorting, filtering, and grouping to gain insights into the sales performance of different branches and product lines. I calculated key metrics such as total sales, average unit price, and total quantity sold for each branch and product line, and I looked at financial metrics such as tax collected, cost of goods sold, and gross margin percentage to understand the profitability of each branch. Additionally, I identified trends in customer behavior by examining data on gender, customer type, and payment type. I also analyzed the average rating for each branch, grouped by gender and customer type. This information was valuable for making informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and other business strategies.
